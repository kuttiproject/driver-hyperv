## Images

This driver depends on Hyper-V VM images published via the [kuttiproject/driver-hyperv-images](https://github.com/kuttiproject/driver-hyperv-images) repository. The details of the driver-to-VM interface are documented there.

The releases of that repository are the default source for this driver. The list of available/deprecated images and the images themselves are published there. The releases match the major and minor versions of this repository, and vice versa.
